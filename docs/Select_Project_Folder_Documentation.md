# Updated Documentation for Implementing the "Select Project Folder" Functionality

## Overview
The "Select Project Folder" functionality allows users to choose a folder containing code files, which the application will analyze and visualize. This feature is essential for understanding file connections and managing project-related notes.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Modify the `MainForm` Class**:
   - Open the `MainForm.cs` file located at `src/DarkTorch/Forms/MainForm.cs`.

2. **Add the Button in the Constructor**:
   - In the `MainForm` constructor, create a new button for selecting the project folder and set its properties.

   ```csharp
   private Button selectFolderButton;

   public MainForm()
   {
       InitializeComponent();
       projectAnalyzer = new ProjectAnalyzer();
       fileManager = new FileManager();
   }
   ```

3. **Initialize the Button**:
   - In the `InitializeComponent` method, add the following code to create and configure the button:

   ```csharp
   selectFolderButton = new Button
   {
       Text = "Select Project Folder",
       Location = new Point(10, 10), // Position the button at the top left
       Size = new Size(150, 30) // Set the size of the button
   };
   selectFolderButton.Click += SelectFolderButton_Click; // Attach the click event handler
   this.Controls.Add(selectFolderButton); // Add the button to the form
   ```

4. **Implement the Button Click Event**:
   - Create the `SelectFolderButton_Click` method to handle the folder selection logic:

   ```csharp
   private void SelectFolderButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
   {
       using (var folderBrowser = new FolderBrowserDialog())
       {
           folderBrowser.Description = "Select a project folder to analyze.";
           DialogResult result = folderBrowser.ShowDialog();

           if (result == DialogResult.OK && !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(folderBrowser.SelectedPath))
           {
               List<FileInfo> files = projectAnalyzer.AnalyzeProject(folderBrowser.SelectedPath);
               Dictionary<string, List<string>> connections = projectAnalyzer.FindFileConnections(files);
               fileVisualizer.SetFileConnections(connections);
               fileManager.LoadNotes(folderBrowser.SelectedPath);
           }
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Visualize File Connections**:
   - The `FileVisualizer` class will be responsible for displaying the connections between files. You can enhance the visualization to resemble a graph view similar to Obsidian, where notes are represented as nodes and their connections as lines.

   ```csharp
   protected override void OnPaint(PaintEventArgs e)
   {
       base.OnPaint(e);
       if (fileConnections == null) return;

       using (Pen pen = new Pen(Color.Black))
       using (Font font = new Font(FontFamily.GenericSansSerif, 8))
       {
           foreach (var file in fileConnections.Keys)
           {
               // Draw file representation (e.g., rectangle)
               Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(...); // Calculate position
               e.Graphics.DrawRectangle(pen, rect);
               e.Graphics.DrawString(Path.GetFileName(file), font, Brushes.Black, rect);

               // Draw connections
               foreach (var connectedFile in fileConnections[file])
               {
                   // Calculate positions for lines
                   Point start = new Point(...); // Center of the current file
                   Point end = new Point(...); // Center of the connected file
                   e.Graphics.DrawLine(pen, start, end);
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

6. **Run and Test the Application**:
   - After implementing the changes, run the application to verify that the "Select Project Folder" button is visible and functional. Click the button to ensure that the folder browser dialog opens and that you can select a project folder.

## Additional Context
The visualization aspect of the application can be inspired by graph views from applications like Obsidian, where notes are represented as nodes, and their connections are visualized as lines connecting the nodes. This approach helps users understand the relationships between different files and notes, creating a more intuitive experience.

The image appears to show a graph view from Obsidian, a knowledge management and note-taking application. In this view, notes are represented as nodes, and their connections (links between notes) are visualized as lines connecting the nodes. 

The graph seems to depict a complex web of interconnected notes, likely representing a personal knowledge database or a second brain. The darker background and clustered layout suggest an organized structure where some topics or notes are more interconnected than others.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you can successfully implement the "Select Project Folder" functionality in DarkTorch.
